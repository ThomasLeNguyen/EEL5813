% STEPS TO USE FUNCTION percept1p to solve Prob. P4.4
%
% FIRST copy the percept1p.m file to a know directory
% for example, to C:\5813
% THEN change directory (in Matlab) TO THAT directory
cd C:\5813
% check you are in the desired directory
pwd
% it should display the path C:\5813
% Check percept1p.m is there
dir
% the file name   percep1p.m should appear 
% % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % 
% NOW SOLVE PROBLEM P4.4 (page 4-26 of book):
% Create the 4 pattern vectors and their targets
%
p1 = [2 ; 2]
t1 = 0
%
p2 = [1 ; -2]
t2 = 1
%
p3 = [ -2 ;2]
t3 = 0
%
p4 = [ -1 ;1]
t4 = 1
%
% INITIALIZE WEIGHTS AND BIAS
Wold = [0 , 0]
bold = 0
%
%%% EPOCH 1
display(' EPOCH 1 ')
% Present (learn from) p1
display('pattern p1')
[Wnew, bnew,e] = percept1p(Wold, bold, p1, t1);
% Update weights and bias:
Wold = Wnew
bold = bnew
%
% Present (learn from) p2
display('pattern p2')
[Wnew, bnew,e] = percept1p(Wold, bold, p2, t2);
% Update weights and bias:
Wold = Wnew
bold = bnew
%
% Present (learn from) p3
display('pattern p3')
[Wnew, bnew,e] = percept1p(Wold, bold, p3, t3);
% Update weights and bias:
Wold = Wnew
bold = bnew
%
% Present (learn from) p4
display('pattern p4')
[Wnew, bnew,e] = percept1p(Wold, bold, p4, t4);
% Update weights and bias:
Wold = Wnew
bold = bnew
%
%
%%% EPOCH 2
display(' EPOCH 2 ')
% Present (learn from) p1
display('pattern p1')
[Wnew, bnew,e] = percept1p(Wold, bold, p1, t1);
% Update weights and bias:

% Present (learn from) p2
display('pattern p2')
[Wnew, bnew,e] = percept1p(Wold, bold, p2, t2);
% Update weights and bias:
Wold = Wnew
bold = bnew

display('You can continue with pattern p3 in EPOCH 2, etc')
