    "\n",
    "This chapter provides an introduction to the TensorFlow framework for deep learning. There are different interfaces that can be used to access TensorFlow. In this chapter we begin with the simplest one. We will show how you can quickly get started to perform all aspects of the typical deep learning workflow: load and preprocess data, build a neural network, train the network and evaluate the results.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Theory and Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**TensorFlow** is one of the most popular deep learning frameworks. It was originally developed by the Google Brain group starting in 2011 as DistBelief. It was further developed into TensorFlow and released as open source software in November of 2015. TensorFlow 2.0 became officially available in Sep 2019. It is written in Python and C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is more than one API (Application Programming Interface) for TensorFlow. We will mainly focus on the **Keras** API in this introduction. We will cover other APIs in Chapter 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras was originally developed independently from TensorFlow. According to its developer, Fran&ccedil;ois Chollet, Keras was more of an interface than a framework. This is because Keras was originally designed to act as a frontend for some of the other frameworks. In particular, the TensorFlow, Theano and CNTK frameworks can currently be backends for Keras, and others may be implemented in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras was developed during 2014 and 2015, as part of a research project with ONEIROS. It started as an interface to Theano (a predecessor framework to TensorFlow) that enabled the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolution neural networks. Its first release was in March of 2015. Fran&ccedil;ois Chollet later joined Google, and in 2017 the Google TensorFlow team decided to support Keras in TensorFlow's core library. For TenorFlow 2.0, released in 2019, Keras is the central API for TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in using any framework is to load, format and preprocess the data set. For Keras, the data can be loaded using NumPy arrays (tensors). For other APIs or frameworks the data can be conveniently converted from a NumPy array to a similar tensor format before training. In each case, the important thing to know is what each axis of the tensor represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "For standard multilayer networks the input is a vector with `R` elements, which we often refer to as features. The training data set will have `Q` samples of the input vector. For Keras this can be stored as a `(Q, R)`, or (samples, features), tensor.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For other types of networks the input data can be a time series. In this case, the Keras input will be a 3D tensor of the form (samples, timesteps, features). The term **samples** here indicates the number of different time series in the data set, each of which would be of length *timesteps*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some networks can also accommodate images, which usually have three dimensions: height, width and color. The 4D input tensors for the network have the form (samples, height, width, color). The color (also called *channel*) dimension is usually three (red, green and blue), but can be one for grayscale images or greater than three for multi-spectral images. (It is possible to have the channel axis come before the height and width axes, but channel-last is the default, and it is the format used by TensorFlow.)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible for network inputs to be a time series of images -- a video. The 5D input tensors in this case have the form (samples, timesteps, height, width, channels).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Keras, the network outputs will also be NumPy tensors, which should match the targets. The dimensions for the targets are assigned in the same order as the input dimensions, although the shape of the target is not usually the same as the shape of the input. "

If full batch training is used, then the number of iterations is the same as the number of epochs. However, if minibatches are used, the number of iterations will be larger than the number of epochs.

    "## Advanced Data Loading\n",
    "\n",
    "Loading/formatting/pre-processing data is one of the most important parts of the deep learning workflow. Sometimes this process is referred to as *Exract, Transform and Load* (**ETL**). First, the data are taken from one or multiple files, which may be distributed across multiple machines. Next, the data is transformed. This process can be as simple as normalizing the data, or may involve augmenting data by rotating or scaling images, adding noise, etc. Finally, the data is loaded into the training process, often in minibatches. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, this ETL process can vary significantly from one application to another, so it is difficult to cover all the options. We will give detailed examples for several specific applications in our case study chapters. However, let's take a quick look at some of the advanced data loading concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more sophisticated data loading, you can make the first argument to the `fit` method a **data generator**.  The data generator can be a Python generator, which we described in the Python chapter, or an instance of the `tensorflow.keras.utils.Sequence` class. This class of object is designed for loading data sets. It is expected to have at least two methods: `__get_item__`, which returns the next batch of data, and `__len__`, which returns the number of examples in the data set. It can also have an `on_epoch_end` method, if the data set needs to be modified in some way at each epoch (e.g., by shuffling the data). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of reasons for using a data generator, instead of passing the entire training set into the `fit` method as a NumPy array. First, the data may be too large to fit into memory, so they may need to be loaded one minibatch at a time. Also, you may want to distribute the computation across multiple processors, which can be done conveniently using the `tensorflow.keras.utils.Sequence` class. In addition, a data loader can modify the data during training (e.g., shuffle data or augment data using transformations or noise).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### TensorFlow Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow has a very useful API for creating input pipelines: `tf.data.Dataset`. These pipelines can also be passed to the `fit` method instead of a data generator. There are many ways to use `tf.data.Dataset`, and we will cover several of these in Chapter 11 and in the Case Study chapters. To give an idea of how `tf.data.Dataset` can be used, let's consider one method from the API: `from_tensor_slices`. This method can create a Dataset from a NumPy array, or other types of data structures, like lists and dictionaries. To illustrate the operation, we'll work with the CSV file that we used in the Python chapter and lab.\n",
